# Application Overview

## 1. Flow of the Application

This Node.js enterprise monorepo is designed for scalable, production-ready deployments in MNC environments. The application follows a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific domain. The typical flow is as follows:

1. **Client Request**: Users interact with the system via the API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
2. **API Gateway**: Handles authentication, rate limiting, feature flags, i18n, and proxies requests to backend services.
3. **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, profile management, and user data.
4. **Notification Service**: Handles notifications (email, SMS, push) triggered by user actions or system events.
5. **ETL & AI Modules**: Data flows through ETL pipelines for transformation and enrichment. AI modules provide analytics, recommendations, or automation.
6. **Data Storage**: MongoDB stores user and notification data. Redis is used for caching and fast data access.
7. **Messaging**: Kafka is used for event-driven communication between services (e.g., user registration triggers a notification event).
8. **Monitoring & Scaling**: The system is containerized (Docker), orchestrated via Kubernetes/Helm, and supports scaling and monitoring.

## 2. Services Used in the Application

### Core Services
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, feature flags, i18n, and serverless functions.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and user-related business logic.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications via email, SMS, or push based on events or user actions.

### Supporting Services
- **MongoDB**: Primary database for persistent storage of user and notification data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching, session management, and fast access.
- **Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform for inter-service communication and event-driven workflows.
- **Zookeeper**: Coordinates Kafka clusters and manages distributed configurations.

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and local orchestration of services.
- **Kubernetes & Helm**: Production-grade orchestration, deployment, and scaling.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for cloud resource provisioning.

### Additional Features
- **ETL Pipelines**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading for analytics and reporting.
- **AI Modules**: Machine learning and automation features integrated into services.
- **Feature Flags**: Dynamic feature management for controlled rollouts.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Multi-language support for global users.
- **Rate Limiter**: Protects services from abuse and ensures fair usage.
- **Serverless Functions**: Extensible logic for custom workflows.
